# __Log File Analysis__

## __Overview__
This Python script analyzes cat visit data from a specified log file. The log file should be formatted with each 
line representing a cat visit entry, including at least three elements: cat owner, entry time, and exit time. 
The script extracts relevant information, such as entry and exit times, cat owners, and calculates various statistics, 
including the number of visits, total time in the house, average visit duration, and the longest and shortest visits.

## __Usage__
To use the script, run it from the command line with the log file as a command-line argument. For example:
```
python .\task2.py .\shelter_2023-08-25.log
```
